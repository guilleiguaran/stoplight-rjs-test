== Stoplight Rails 3.1 Prototype RJS Tester

Instructions: Click on the name of a color. The stoplight should turn on that that color.

Stoplight uses Prototype RJS to change the colors -- a page load should not be needed in between color changes. If you're seeing a page load, it's because of this bug: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/2537.

You'll notice that the other lamp colors don't turn off. That's because of this bug: https://github.com/rails/prototype-rails/issues/4

There's a working test version of this app on Heroku:  http://blazing-mist-772.herokuapp.com/

Because of a bug in assets compression on Heroku's Cedar stack, RJS fails.
